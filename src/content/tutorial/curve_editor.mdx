# Summary

The Curve Editor allows you to change how each individual property is animated for the currently selected effects.

## Points

Points are the root of your curve.

You can create a new point by holding `ctrl` and clicking where you want the point to be on the canvas, or by bringing
up the context menu and selecting 'New Point' by clicking on the canvas without holding the `ctrl` key.

### Point Tooltips

Tooltips can be brought up by hovering over a point.

All curves are normalized by nature - they aren't bound by their Start and End values.
Tooltips help you understand where a point is in time and what its value is.

You can make a tooltip show its delta (the difference in time and value from the last point) by holding `shift`.

### Point Shifting

Imagine a scenario where you set up a curve for TimeScale, but then you decided to change the duration of the curve
and now all of the points have different times.

It would be very tedious to shift each point again to have the same Time. Instead, use the point shifter from the
context menu to offset all points based on the old and new values (in this case it's the duration).

### Loading Curves

If you applied a curve to an effect, you can load it back into the editor from the context menu. This only works with curves created by the plugin.

## Presets

Presets are listed in the sidebar and can be created by clicking on the '+' icon above it. Custom presets are listed
at the very bottom and have a context menu you can use to delete, rename, and update a preset.

### Curve Presets

Curve presets only replace the curve for the currently selected property.

### Effect Presets

Effect presets can be distinguished by their icon behind the preset name.

Applying an effect preset replaces curves and inputs for all properties (it only replaces the inputs edited at the time of creating the preset).
